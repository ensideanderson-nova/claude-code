# Commit Commands Plugin

Streamline your git workflow with simple commands for pulling, committing, pushing, and creating pull requests.

## Overview

The Commit Commands Plugin automates common git operations, reducing context switching and manual command execution. Instead of running multiple git commands, use a single slash command to handle your entire workflow.

## Commands

### `/commit`

Creates a git commit with an automatically generated commit message based on staged and unstaged changes.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes current git status
2. Reviews both staged and unstaged changes
3. Examines recent commit messages to match your repository's style
4. Drafts an appropriate commit message
5. Stages relevant files
6. Creates the commit

**Usage:**
```bash
/commit
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make some changes to your code
# Then simply run:
/commit

# Claude will:
# - Review your changes
# - Stage the files
# - Create a commit with an appropriate message
# - Show you the commit status
```

**Features:**
- Automatically drafts commit messages that match your repo's style
- Follows conventional commit practices
- Avoids committing files with secrets (.env, credentials.json)
- Includes Claude Code attribution in commit message

### `/pull`

Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository for the current branch.

**What it does:**
1. Checks if the current branch has a remote tracking branch
2. Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository
3. Shows the status after pulling to confirm the operation
4. Reports any conflicts or issues that need attention

**Usage:**
```bash
/pull
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Before starting work on a shared branch
/pull

# Claude will:
# - Check the remote tracking branch
# - Pull the latest changes
# - Merge them into your current branch
# - Show you the updated status
```

**Features:**
- Automatically pulls from the correct remote tracking branch
- Provides clear feedback about what was updated
- Handles fast-forward merges automatically
- Reports any conflicts that need manual resolution

**When to use:**
- Before starting work on a branch to get the latest changes
- When collaborating with others on the same branch
- To sync your local branch with remote updates
- As part of your regular development workflow

### `/commit-push-pr`

Complete workflow command that commits, pushes, and creates a pull request in one step.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a new branch (if currently on main)
2. Stages and commits changes with an appropriate message
3. Pushes the branch to origin
4. Creates a pull request using `gh pr create`
5. Provides the PR URL

**Usage:**
```bash
/commit-push-pr
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make your changes
# Then run:
/commit-push-pr

# Claude will:
# - Create a feature branch (if needed)
# - Commit your changes
# - Push to remote
# - Open a PR with summary and test plan
# - Give you the PR URL to review
```

**Features:**
- Analyzes all commits in the branch (not just the latest)
- Creates comprehensive PR descriptions with:
  - Summary of changes (1-3 bullet points)
  - Test plan checklist
  - Claude Code attribution
- Handles branch creation automatically
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation

**Requirements:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must have a remote named `origin`

### `/clean_gone`

Cleans up local branches that have been deleted from the remote repository.

**What it does:**
1. Lists all local branches to identify [gone] status
2. Identifies and removes worktrees associated with [gone] branches
3. Deletes all branches marked as [gone]
4. Provides feedback on removed branches

**Usage:**
```bash
/clean_gone
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# After PRs are merged and remote branches are deleted
/clean_gone

# Claude will:
# - Find all branches marked as [gone]
# - Remove any associated worktrees
# - Delete the stale local branches
# - Report what was cleaned up
```

**Features:**
- Handles both regular branches and worktree branches
- Safely removes worktrees before deleting branches
- Shows clear feedback about what was removed
- Reports if no cleanup was needed

**When to use:**
- After merging and deleting remote branches
- When your local branch list is cluttered with stale branches
- During regular repository maintenance

## Installation

This plugin is included in the Claude Code repository. The commands are automatically available when using Claude Code.

## Best Practices

### Using `/pull`
- Always pull before starting new work on a shared branch
- Run after switching to a branch that others are working on
- Use to stay synchronized with team changes
- Review the changes that were pulled in
- Resolve any conflicts immediately

### Using `/commit`
- Review the staged changes before committing
- Let Claude analyze your changes and match your repo's commit style
- Trust the automated message, but verify it's accurate
- Use for routine commits during development

### Using `/commit-push-pr`
- Use when you're ready to create a PR
- Ensure all your changes are complete and tested
- Claude will analyze the full branch history for the PR description
- Review the PR description and edit if needed
- Use when you want to minimize context switching

### Using `/clean_gone`
- Run periodically to keep your branch list clean
- Especially useful after merging multiple PRs
- Safe to run - only removes branches already deleted remotely
- Helps maintain a tidy local repository

## Workflow Integration

### Collaborative workflow:
```bash
# Start work on a shared branch
/pull  # Get latest changes
# Write code
/commit  # Commit your changes
# Ready to create PR (consider /pull if working on active branch)
/commit-push-pr  # Push and create PR
```

### Quick commit workflow:
```bash
# Write code
/commit
# Continue development
```

### Feature branch workflow:
```bash
# Develop feature across multiple commits
/commit  # First commit
# More changes
/commit  # Second commit
# Ready to create PR
/commit-push-pr
```

### Maintenance workflow:
```bash
# After several PRs are merged
/clean_gone
# Clean workspace ready for next feature
```

## Requirements

- Git must be installed and configured
- For `/commit-push-pr`: GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must be a git repository with a remote

## Troubleshooting

### `/pull` merge conflicts

**Issue**: Merge conflicts after pulling

**Solution**:
- Review conflicting files using `git status`
- Resolve conflicts manually in the affected files
- Stage resolved files with `git add <file>`
- Complete the merge with `git commit`

### `/pull` no tracking branch

**Issue**: Current branch has no upstream tracking branch

**Solution**:
- Set tracking branch: `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> <local-branch>`
- Or push with tracking: `git push -u origin <branch>`
- Create a PR first if the branch doesn't exist remotely

### `/commit` creates empty commit

**Issue**: No changes to commit

**Solution**:
- Ensure you have unstaged or staged changes
- Run `git status` to verify changes exist

### `/commit-push-pr` fails to create PR

**Issue**: `gh pr create` command fails

**Solution**:
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [GitHub CLI installation](https://cli.github.com/)
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Ensure repository has a GitHub remote

### `/clean_gone` doesn't find branches

**Issue**: No branches marked as [gone]

**Solution**:
- Run `git fetch --prune` to update remote tracking
- Branches must be deleted from the remote to show as [gone]

## Tips

- **Pull before starting work**: Always run `/pull` when starting work on a shared branch
- **Combine with other tools**: Use `/pull` to sync, `/commit` during development, then `/commit-push-pr` when ready
- **Let Claude draft messages**: The commit message analysis learns from your repo's style
- **Regular cleanup**: Run `/clean_gone` weekly to maintain a clean branch list
- **Review before pushing**: Always review the commit message and changes before pushing
